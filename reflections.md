# Reflections
The overall git experience has been quite smooth so far. Making a new branch and merging it into the the master branch went well. One thing that surprised us was the visibility of the branches, since there is a clear distinction between a local branch and a global branch. After a branch is merged, the old branch needs to be manually cleaned up both on the git server and on the local git repository of the creator. We would like to improve the naming convention of the branches. At the moment we simply name it after the main feature that is implemented on that branch, but we could look into the git branching model by [Vincent Driessen](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). In this model a fixed number of branches are created which are reused over the course of the projet.
